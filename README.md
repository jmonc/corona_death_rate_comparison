# Comparison of the normal death rate in China to the probability of dying after contracting the coronavirus.

I am not a healthcare professional, nothing here should be taken as fact. This is only meant to be a comparison of risk. Specifically the likely hood that a Chinese citizen would have died during the entire year of 2010 to the likelihood of dying after contracting the coronavirus.

Any simple attempt to interpolate this to other countries is likely incorrect. 

My own reading is that the danger to a Chinese citizen from contracting the coronavirus is similar to the danger of living 1-2 years of normal life.
